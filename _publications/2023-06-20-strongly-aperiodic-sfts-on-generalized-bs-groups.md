In particular, we prove that all generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups (GBS) admit a strongly aperiodic SFT. Our proof is based on a structural theorem by Whyte and on two constructions of strongly aperiodic SFTs on 𝔽_𝑛 × ℤ and 𝐵𝑆(𝑚,𝑛) of our own. Our two constructions rely on a path-folding technique that lifts an SFT on ℤ^2 inside an SFT on 𝔽_𝑛 × ℤ or an SFT on the hyperbolic plane inside an SFT on 𝐵𝑆(𝑚,𝑛). In the case of 𝔽_𝑛 × ℤ, the path folding technique also preserves minimality, so that we get minimal strongly aperiodic SFTs on unimodular GBS groups.
